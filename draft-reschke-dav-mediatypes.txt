           Internet Media Types for WebDAV Protocol Payloads
                  draft-reschke-dav-mediatypes-latest

Abstract

   WebDAV (RFC 4918, "HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and
   Versioning") and related specifications use XML in HTTP requests and
   responses, but do not define specific Internet Media Types.  This
   hinders reuse of these formats in other contexts, such as when these
   formats are negotiated or content is persisted outside a WebDAV
   protocol flow.

   This document assigns Internet Media Types to those WebDAV message
   formats that could be used outside the original protocol context.

1.  Introduction

   WebDAV ("HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and
   Versioning", [RFC4918]) and related specifications extend HTTP
   [RFChttp] with methods related to authoring and versioning.  Most of
   these methods use XML [XML] in the contents of requests and
   responses.

   Section 8.2 of [RFC4918] requires WebDAV components to support the
   Internet Media Type [RFC2046] "application/xml" (and recommends to
   support "text/html" although deprecated).  It does not define more
   specific types, though.  The semantics of request/response contents
   is inferred either from context (method name) or from the name of the
   document (root) element.

   This approach works fine for the use cases addressed by WebDAV (and
   this document does not attempt to change this).  However, the lack of
   more specific media types hinders use of these XML formats outside
   their original use cases.  For instance:

   *  Identifying formats outside their original WebDAV uses cases, such
      as for payloads of the HTTP PATCH method [RFC5789].

   *  Promoting contents from WebDAV messages to "real" HTTP resources
      (retrievable by GET).

   *  Annotating Web links [RFC8288] with type information.
