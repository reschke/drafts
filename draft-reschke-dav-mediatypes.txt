           Internet Media Types for WebDAV Protocol Payloads
                  draft-reschke-dav-mediatypes-latest

Abstract

   WebDAV (RFC 4918, "HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and
   Versioning") and related specifications use XML in HTTP requests and
   responses, but do not define specific Internet Media Types.  This
   hinders reuse of these formats in other contexts, such as when these
   formats are negotiated or content is persisted outside a WebDAV
   protocol flow.

   This document assigns Internet Media Types to those WebDAV message
   formats that could be used outside the original protocol context.
